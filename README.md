# X3-JAM, A new O2-JAM 1.8 Server Emulation
Currently the project on alpha (or heavy development)

There two entry point in this solution: 
- `Estrol.X3Jam.Console` - Console based server (Can crossplatform)
- `Estrol.X3Jam.WPF` - GUI based Server (Windows only)

## Compiling
You need .NET Framework 4.5 (.NET 5 coming soon) \
and a Mixed Assembly DLL from `System.Data.SQLite` (based on which platform you compiled)
